# Missile detection and destruction 

- A missile flies into your territory. 

- Radar tracks the incoming missile for three seconds and give you three (X,Y) coordinate positions.

- From that information the program estimates the missile's trajectory to predict where it will be in 3 seconds.

- The system fires a high powered laser beam that hits and destroys the incoming. All within 6 seconds.
